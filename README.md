# hw1-refactoring
First homework assignment - refactor a simple page with CSS

I did the following:
  > added the "alt" tags to the images for disability access as described in the instructions as a goal 
  > removed the unnecessary ID references in the index file
  > grouped together the related CSS classes and ID's in the CSS file 
  > I also attempted (still working on it) simplifying the classes for the sections - since the are all identical one would expect that it unnecssary to have each defined separately ... it seems as if that makes the CSS file full of redundant information when one Class for the main big blocks on the lef and one for the strip on the right should work.
